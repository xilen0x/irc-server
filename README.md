## Objectives

Understand the functionality of the IRC protocol and its implementation in a server.

Learn how to manage sockets and I/O conections.

Develop skills in network programming and concurrency management.

Improve error handling and security in servers.

## Languages & Technologies

C++98

TCP/IP Sockets

I/O connections.

IRC Protocol (RFC 1459)

Makefile

## Features

Server based on TCP/IP sockets.

Support for multiple simultaneous connections.

Compatible with traditional IRC clients.

Implementation of key IRC protocol commands:

/NICK - Change user nickname.

/USER - Identify the user on the server.

/JOIN - Join a channel.

/PRIVMSG - Send private messages.

/KICK - Remove users from a channel.

/MODE - Modify user and channel modes.

/TOPIC - Set the channel topic.

/QUIT - Disconnect from the server.

/PASS - to connect to the server.

## Installation & Execution

```
git clone https://github.com/xilen0x/irc-server.git
cd irc-server
```
Compile the project:

```
make
```
Run the server with the required parameters:

```./ircserv <port> <password>```

In another terminal, connect using an IRC client such as irssi.

/server localhost <port> -p <password>
```
irssi -c 127.0.0.1 -p 50000 -w password -n nickname -!
```
